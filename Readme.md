### Simple 2D phisics simulator

The program uses GJK and EPA algorithms, so it can support any 2D bodies if we disassemble them into convex shapes.  
  
Unfortunately at this point i can consider it glitchless when framing at least 120 rate..  
Maybe i will find and solve this problem soon, but mightly i will pay more attention to create the same whole thing for 3D space.  
Also program don't yet have BVH broad phase collision detection.
  
Here is a link to youtube :)
